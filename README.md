# Overview
This repository contains all code, data, documents and other files that I have created during my internship program from Jun 2023 to Nov 2023.

# Video noise detection
I worked on this topic in July 2023, solving the task of detecting visual noises and defects in video. My main approach was to categorize all video noises into 7 groups, and tackle them individually. The 7 categories are:
- Impulse noise
- Image glitch
- Blur
- Periodic noise
- Scratches & blotches
- Freeze frame
- Snow/TV static
<br>
The topic was unfinished, since I was introduced to another project in August 2023. You can find all source code & data related to the first 4 categories in the folder VideoNoiseDetection.

## Impulse noise

## Image glitch

## Blur

## Periodic noise

# Flicker detection
I worked on this topic from August to the end of my internship program. After some discussions with the tester team from EMC2, I was given access to all of CCS2BUG tickets. During August, I have managed to collect more than 200 videos recording steps to reproduce failed test cases. These videos come in the form of camera records or screen capture.
